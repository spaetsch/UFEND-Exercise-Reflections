What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a metadata file about all the files in the directory but it does not yet take the first snapshot. It is laying the groundwork for the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a intermediary location between the working directory, where you are doing your work, and the repository, which holds your finalized updates. The staging area allows you to bundle files together if they have a logical connection to create one coherent commit.
