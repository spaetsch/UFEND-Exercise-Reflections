When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It makes it easier to share your work with others. It also makes it possible to work privately on issues on your local machine before sharing them with the rest of the team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To prevent conflicts in your work. While Git can try to merge the code, it is safer for you to decide when your work is ready to be integrated with any changes that have happened on the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   A fork makes a personal copy of a repository on GitHub. This new repository is also located on GitHub. Cloning creates a local copy of a repository. Branching creates a new line of commits within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps determine how to proceed with a merge. It shows you at what point you last updated from the remote, so you know that prior to that point, the remote and local repos are the same.
